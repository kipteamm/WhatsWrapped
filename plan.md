### Key Details of the Reveal Flow:
1. **Narrative Structure:** It builds suspense by revealing smaller insights first and saving the most impressive data (like the best day, longest streak, etc.) for later.
2. **Text Animations:** The use of fun text effects (counting numbers, exploding text, floating emojis) keeps the flow dynamic.
3. **Visuals:** Use of graphs, charts, and progress bars to visualize the data in an engaging way.
4. **Anticipation:** Build-up between cards to keep the user excited about what‚Äôs next. The transition from data-driven insights to fun visuals adds to the excitement.

This structure should keep users engaged and excited as they move from one interesting insight to the next, creating a smooth experience similar to Spotify Wrapped!
