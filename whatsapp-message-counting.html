            <h2>Why Count Your WhatsApp Messages?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how many messages you've exchanged on WhatsApp with your friends, family, or colleagues? Knowing your total message count can be fun, nostalgic, and even surprising. But why stop there? With <strong>WhatsWrapped</strong>, you can go beyond the numbers and uncover detailed insights about your chats.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How to Get Your Total WhatsApp Messages</h2>
            <p>To get your total WhatsApp messages, you can use some of WhatsApp's limited built in methods. This first method gives you your overall total (sent from your current device), alongside some other statistics.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open WhatsApp on your phone.</li>
                <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Storage and Data</strong> > <strong>Network usage</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>While this method works, it's limited. Another method is to manually go through your Whatsapp Chat exports, (or use a too like <a href="https://www.whatswrapped.net/">WhatsWrapped</a>, more on that later).</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open WhatsApp on your phone.</li>
                <li>Navigate to <strong>your chat</strong> > <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>More</strong> > <strong>Export chat</strong> > <strong>Without media</strong>.</li>
                <li>Share the export with yourself and open it in your .txt reader of choice.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                While these Chat Exports hold a lot of data, the format in which they come make it very hard to use. That is why you can use a tool like <strong>WhatsWrapped</strong>.
